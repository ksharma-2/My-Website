                        <p>I implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm,
                            a pathfinding algorithm, and a pipeline as a way for the UI to
                            interact with the algorithm. The goal was to mimic a GPS navigation
                            system for the City of Edmonton roadways.

                            Dietscoop is an app designed to allow users to plan their meals. The app is designed
                            so users can add existing ingredients, recipes and schedule meal plans. The app was
                            created using Android Studio, Java was the main source of the back-end, Firebase was
                            used as the database, and XML was used for the front-end. The app was made within a
                            group of 5, where we implemented Agile/Scrum practices.

                        <p>Kumquat is an NFT creation sandbox that was designed with the intention
                            to allow users new to the NFT space to learn about NFT creation. The
                            app would allow users to interact with the Hedera testnet to create
                            custom text-based NFTs known as a "Kumquat". This project was created
                            for HackEd 2022.
